// Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
// If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

// 1st Version
let alien_color:string = "red";
 if (alien_color == "red"){
   console.log("You have earned 5 points");
}
else{
    console.log("You have earned 10 points");
}

// 2nd Version
let Alien_color:string = "yellow";
if (Alien_color == "blue"){
    console.log("You have earned 5 points");
}
else {
    console.log("You have earned 10 points");
}
